Fullstack Academy Unit 1 Career Simulator - Personal Website

The first of many iterations of my Personal Website, throughout my time at Fullstack Academy.

This project will encompase all of the knowledge that I will learn at my time in this bootcamp. Overtime this Personal Website will evolve the more I learn.

Overview

For Part 1 the goal of this project is to use the limited knowledge we have to create 3 pages. The Home Page, About Me Page, and Portfolio page.

At this point we know basic HTML, CSS, and very little JavaScript. We would need to first create our Home Page, About Me, and Portfolio with HTML then style it with CSS.

Afterwards we will still need to implement our JavaScript with no expectation to make the website interative.
