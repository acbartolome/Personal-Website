                <h2 class="hobbyName">Coffee</h2>
                <p>I got seriously into coffee during the start of COVID. While I was working at my first coporate job there was a floor with a dedicated coffee bar. It had coffee shop grade espresso machine, with various pour over methods. After learning how to make coffee at work I got hooked into the world of coffee. Especially with during COVID I got more invested. I purchased all of the necessary tools to make pour over coffee.</p>
                <p>Over time and lots of practice I was abe to develop my sense of taste when it comes to coffee beans and my daily recipe and measurements. I'm still learning more about coffee everyday from different YouTube videos and articles that I read.</p>

                <h2 class="hobbyName">Mechanical Keyboards</h2>
                <p>Another hobby I got into during COVID. Once I built my first gaming PC, I heard about custom mechanical keyboards from a friend of mine who built them live on Twitch. Afterwards I bought all of the parts necessary to build my first keyboard. It was a very simple keyboard at the time but I was so excited to use it.</p>
                <p>Over time I have started to build some of my own keyboards and I currently have 3 keyboards in my collection. The picture in one of my favorite boards that I have the moment60 by JJW. This board is considered my "endgame" board with the typing feeling and sound that I prefer the most.</p>

                <h2 class="hobbyName">Reading</h2>
                <p>When I was younger I was an avid reader constantly spending most of my childhood going to the library and borrowing dozens of books at a time. As I got older I stopped reading as I got into different interest. In 2024 my new years resolution was to read 1 book a month and total to 12 books in the year. </p>
                <p>With this challenge I have sparked my interest in reading again after finishing 2 books so far in 2024 (as of writing it is March 2024). I plan to continue to read more even after the new years as I've found the genre of books that I enjoy to read.</p>
